# Countries-Vaccination-Dataset-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Countries Vaccination Dataset, which provides insights into global vaccination efforts, primarily against COVID-19. The dataset contains crucial information about vaccination trends, population coverage, and vaccine distribution patterns across various countries. Using this dataset, the project aims to uncover insights, visualize trends, and support data-driven policy-making.

the dataset have column like this  country,	iso_code	,date	,total_vaccinations	,people_vaccinated,	people_fully_vaccinated	,daily_vaccinations_raw,	daily_vaccinations	,total_vaccinations_per_hundred,	people_vaccinated_per_hundred	,people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred	,daily_vaccinations_per_million	vaccines

**Import & Preprocessing:**

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Inspected the shape and data types.

Checked for and handled duplicate entries.

Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns.

Replaced missing values (NaNs) with appropriate methods (e.g., forward fill, zero).

Removed duplicates based on the vaccine and country columns.

Generated descriptive statistics using data.describe().
